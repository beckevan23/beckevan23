- 👋 Hi, I’m @beckevan23
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end development.
- 🌱 I’m currently using "The Odin Project" and "Python Crash Course" book by Eric Matthes to start learning what I'm doing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Python, node.js, SQL, I don't know to be honest. I would like to see how professionals code or learn with others.
- 📫 You can email me at evan.beck23@gmail.com.
